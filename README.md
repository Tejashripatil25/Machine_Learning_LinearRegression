# Machine_Learning_LinearRegression
Simple linear regression is a parametric test, meaning that it makes certain assumptions about the data.

Regression
The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.

In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.

Linear Regression
Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.

This line can be used to predict future values.

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. 
When the number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, 

and in the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression. 

The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. 
The equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. 

The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).

Linear regression is used in many different fields, including finance, economics, and psychology, to understand and predict the behavior of a particular variable. 

For example, in finance, linear regression might be used to understand the relationship between a companyâ€™s stock price and its earnings or to predict the future value of a currency based on its past performance.

How Does it Work?

Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression. We will show you how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula.

In the example below, the x-axis represents age, and the y-axis represents speed. We have registered the age and speed of 13 cars as they were passing a tollbooth. Let us see if the data we collected could be used in a linear regression:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Start by drawing a scatter plot:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]

y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

plt.scatter(x, y)

plt.show()

Result:
